# AnimalWars

This is a project for the exam of Web and Mobile Applications. 
The aim of the project is to build a web social network where users can post images of animals. Users can also play a game where they get two 
random posted images and vote their favorite between them. Most voted images get an higher score and they will appear first in the home page.

The project is composed by:
- A SQLlite database
- A backend in python with Django REST Framework
- A web frontend with React
- A mobile app with Flutter
